Remove CLI flags: -r short, -w, -y, --agi. Keep --read (long only) and --no-sandbox. See ai/design/permissions-v2.md for complete file-by-file migration plan.",

Kept --read (long) and --no-sandbox. 870 lines deleted. Review found --read not wired to CLI run mode — fixed. Removed unimplemented deny_commands config field. Updated stale docs. All 314 tests pass."
