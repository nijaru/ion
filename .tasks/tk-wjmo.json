      "msg": "Implemented queue preservation hardening: agent run_task now drains queued messages both before turns and once more after final-answer turns (no tools) to avoid late steering loss; TUI update restores any queued messages back into input on Finished/Error/session-finalization before dropping queue; input Up-arrow recall now recovers poisoned queue locks. Added unit tests in src/agent/mod.rs and src/tui/session/update.rs. Validation: cargo test -q (443 pass) and cargo clippy -q clean."
