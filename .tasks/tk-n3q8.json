  "description": "read_lines_single_pass uses BufReader::lines() which always does UTF-8 decode. After collecting the needed line window, remaining lines are decoded just to count total_lines. For large files with offset/limit, this wastes CPU. Fix: switch to byte-counting (like count_lines_streaming) after the window.",
