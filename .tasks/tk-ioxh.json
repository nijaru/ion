  "description": "Research and design how to run async subagents — parallel tool execution, background tasks, agent composition. Review what Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others do. Balance SOTA features with proven effectiveness. Key: modular design so these compose well with agent loop, harness, system prompt. Depends on clean provider/agent architecture.",
