  "description": "When resuming with --continue, the progress completion line (elapsed, tokens, cost) is blank because TaskSummary is in-memory only. Need to persist it in the session store (last_elapsed, last_input_tokens, last_output_tokens, last_cost, last_was_cancelled) and reconstruct TaskSummary on load.",
