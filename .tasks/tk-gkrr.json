  "description": "gpt-5.x-codex models were trained on Responses API format (local_shell native tool, freeform apply_patch). Ion uses Chat Completions with standard function tools — format mismatch is the biggest performance gap vs Codex CLI. Requires new provider implementation path alongside existing openai_compat. See ai/research/codex-cli-system-prompt-tools-2026.md for full analysis.",
