  "description": "On session load, the progress line is blank because completion state (model, tokens, duration) isn't stored. This makes the UI look wrong on restart and creates a visual gap inconsistency (empty progress row looks like an extra blank line). Should persist the last completion summary alongside the session so it renders correctly on resume.",
