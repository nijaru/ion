      "msg": "BUG: When a tool (especially bash) is executing, Ctrl+C triggers the double-tap quit flow instead of interrupting the tool. The abort_token.cancel() should propagate to kill the child process via kill_on_drop, but the TUI doesn't recognize Ctrl+C as an interrupt during tool execution - it treats it as a quit attempt. Need to check if is_running and tool is active, then cancel the tool rather than triggering quit flow."
