# Status: ion (Go)

Fast, lightweight terminal coding agent.

## Current Focus

Ion has been reconciled with the current stabilized Canto surface. The core loop audit, HITL permission-mode hardening, observability exporter slice, workflow topology spec, first eval regression gate, deterministic policy config slice, first executable subagent persona/routing slice, workspace trust slice, tool-loading UX slice, and first memory search UX slice are complete. Current work is moving through the remaining P2 reliability/UX epics.

Current active slice:
- `tk-90mp` — Streaming: Cost Limits & Model Cascades. Provider limit classification is now implemented; continue with any remaining budget/cascade behavior only when it strengthens the core loop.
- `tk-00km` — HITL notifier delivery and audit. First Slack/SMTP delivery and audit slice is in progress.
- `tk-a5ds` — Config UX umbrella. P3 tracking bucket; do not let polish outrank core loop reliability.
- `tk-8188` — Settings storage split. P3 design follow-up; current code still stores selected provider/model in config, but the target layout separates stable config from mutable runtime state.
- `tk-hase` — Thinking: provider-compatible levels and UI settings. P3 design follow-up; current provider survey says capability-filtered named levels in the TUI, config-only numeric budgets, and no reasoning params for unknown custom endpoints.

Captured lower-priority polish:
- `tk-5cqs` — Slash commands: autocomplete and command surface review (P3)
- `tk-c037` — TUI: question-mark help shortcut (completed)

Near-term tracks:
- `tk-wqhg` — Permission UX: trust and mode semantics (Completed)
- `tk-0kip` — Provider/model picker: non-listing providers and preset clarity (Completed)
- `tk-hs3m` — Local API: keep system messages template-compatible (Completed through Canto context primitive integration)
- `tk-a5ds` — Config UX umbrella (Active/P3)
- `tk-8188` — Settings storage: split stable config from mutable state (Active/P3 design follow-up)
- `tk-2wrb` — Context: Compaction UX & Summarization Prompts (Completed)
- `tk-96vy` — Core loop: reliability and resilience audit (Completed)
- `tk-j3ap` — HITL: Permission Modes UX & Escalation (Completed; notifier delivery split to `tk-00km`)
- `tk-wzt6` — Observability: OTel Exporter & Dashboards (Completed)
- `tk-tyww` — Workflow: Workflow Definitions & Recovery (Completed)
- `tk-txju` — Eval: Golden Datasets & Regression Gates (Completed)
- `tk-zbxk` — Security: Policy Config & LLM-as-Judge (Deterministic config complete; LLM judge split)
- `tk-9lws` — Security: LLM-as-judge classifier and circuit breaker (Completed foundation; model adapter deferred)
- `tk-r5jr` — Subagent: Agent Personas & Model Routing (Completed)
- `tk-z2cb` — Workspace: Trust UX & Visual Rollback (Trust complete; rewind split)
- `tk-yf7v` — Tool Execution: Tool Loading UX & Approval Tiers (Completed)
- `tk-gxfu` — Memory: Karpathy-Style Knowledge Base & Search UX (Search UX complete; wiki split)
- `tk-90mp` — Streaming: Cost Limits & Model Cascades (Next P2)
- `tk-fblb` — Migrate Ion to current Canto surface (Completed)
- `tk-ulfg` — Research: current Pi core loop and feature review (Completed)
- `tk-arhu` / `tk-5vrj` — Verified subagent multiplexing and durable breadcrumbs (Completed)
- TUI refinements — Fixed history navigation boundary behavior (Completed)

Everything else is downstream of the solo agent core. SOTA epics are important, but they do not outrank a reliable submit/stream/tool/approval/cancel/error/persist/replay loop.

Provider work to keep in mind:
- most providers remain API-key or custom-endpoint integrations
- subscription/OAuth providers need explicit treatment
- OpenAI ChatGPT subscription support for third-party apps was raised; verify from official sources before design depends on it.
- **Model cascades (SOTA 14):** Enforcing cost limits and routing tasks to cheaper models dynamically.

Design rule:
- v0.0.0 has no compatibility debt; current bindings and config shapes are allowed to change directly if the end-state is better. New SOTA plans supersede older designs where there is conflict.
- Do not overfit cost/routing work to DSPy, GEPA, or optimizer-centric designs. Keep Ion closer to pi's simple clever model: explicit presets, inspectable decisions, and only the routing knobs that improve the coding workflow.
- Similar agents are references, not feature-parity requirements. Adopt from pi, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Droid, Letta, and others only when the idea strengthens Ion's core coding loop or preserves a simple, inspectable UX.

## Next Steps
1. Resume `tk-90mp`: budget enforcement, rate-limit/quota behavior, and routing trace slices are the next core-loop resilience work.
2. Return to `tk-00km` after budget/rate-limit semantics are settled; approval prompts/audit copy now have the updated mode/trust matrix.
3. Keep `tk-a5ds`, `tk-8188`, and `tk-5cqs` as tracked UX/config polish rather than core-loop blockers.
4. Keep `tk-a5ds`, `tk-5cqs`, and `tk-c037` as tracked UX polish unless a concrete bug blocks normal use.
5. Treat older `Canto: contribute ...` tasks as re-triaged: no default grep/glob or preset coding-tool bundles; only concrete reusable extension packages should move upstream.

*(Note: Older P3 TUI refinement tasks like configurable verbosity, skill layering, and status line context have been subsumed by their respective SOTA epics).*

## Completed (Recent)
- [x] **HITL notifier delivery slice (`tk-00km`)** — Approval requests now attempt Slack webhook and SMTP email notification when ESCALATE.md channels and credentials are configured, while auditing sent/failed/skipped outcomes without blocking the local approval prompt.
- [x] **Provider-limit resilience slice (`tk-90mp`)** — Rate/quota/context/capacity provider failures now get readable UI prefixes while preserving raw provider text and append durable `routing_decision` stop traces. Verified with `go test ./...` and Fedora `local-api` smoke against `qwen3.6:27b-uncensored`.
- [x] **Compaction UX slice (`tk-2wrb`)** — Added visible compacting progress, follow-up queueing while manual compaction runs, and Ion summarizer guidance that preserves goals, paths, task IDs, decisions, failures, and verification status.
- [x] **Policy classifier foundation (`tk-9lws`)** — Added optional EDIT-mode classifier hook for existing `ask` decisions, with timeout/model-error/invalid-action fallback to `ask`, hard-boundary protection, and auditable policy events.
- [x] **Sandbox hardening (`tk-kfno`)** — Explicit Seatbelt/bubblewrap modes fail closed when unavailable, bubblewrap planning skips missing platform paths, and sandbox posture is visible at startup and through `/tools`.
- [x] **Checkpoint rewind (`tk-8e2x`)** — Native file tools create durable pre-change checkpoints; `/rewind <id>` previews restore actions and `/rewind <id> --confirm` restores with transcript start/completion entries.
- [x] **Core loop reliability audit (`tk-96vy`)** — Completed final approval/session-switch review; approval bridge failures now surface as session errors and unknown tool result IDs cannot clear another pending tool.
- [x] **Permission mode startup slice (`tk-j3ap`)** — READ mode is now non-escalating even with stale session approvals; `--mode auto`/`--yolo` startup selection now applies to TUI and print sessions, with non-interactive approvals limited to AUTO.
- [x] **ESCALATE.md host slice (`tk-j3ap`)** — Ion now loads root `ESCALATE.md` via Canto's workspace parser and surfaces declared email/Slack channels plus approval timeout in approval prompts.
- [x] **HITL task closure (`tk-j3ap`)** — Closed the safe host scope and split actual Slack/email delivery into `tk-00km` pending credential, timeout, and audit design.
- [x] **Observability exporter/dashboard (`tk-wzt6`)** — Added config/env-driven OTLP trace and metric export for Canto telemetry plus a Grafana starter dashboard; `go test ./...` passes.
- [x] **Workflow topology spec (`tk-tyww`)** — Defined Ion-owned Code Review and Bug Fix workflow DAGs, checkpoint recovery policy, and human-gate rules on top of Canto graph primitives.
- [x] **Eval golden gate (`tk-txju`)** — Moved prompt quality checks into `evals/golden/prompt_quality.toml`, kept them enforced by `go test ./...`, and documented future eval artifact policy.
- [x] **Deterministic policy config (`tk-zbxk`)** — Added `policy_path`/`~/.ion/policy.yaml` YAML rules for exact tools and categories across Canto/ACP backends; READ remains non-weakenable and LLM-as-judge is split to a follow-up.
- [x] **Subagent personas and model routing (`tk-r5jr`)** — Registered the native `subagent` tool with built-in explorer/reviewer/worker personas, global YAML-frontmatter overrides, fast/primary model-slot routing, and scoped child tool registries.
- [x] **Workspace trust (`tk-z2cb`)** — Added user-global trusted workspace state, startup downgrade to READ for untrusted checkouts, `/trust`, and docs; visual rewind is split pending checkpoint semantics.
- [x] **Tool loading UX (`tk-yf7v`)** — Surfaced Canto lazy-tool state in startup and `/tools`; kept approval tiers to READ/EDIT/AUTO plus policy rules instead of adding redundant modes.
- [x] **Memory search UX (`tk-gxfu`)** — Added `/memory` tree/search over Canto workspace memory and documented wiki/collection-management deferral.
- [x] **Core loop audit slices (`tk-96vy`)** — Fixed native/ACP commit-before-finish ordering, sticky error/cancel terminal states, cancellation queue clearing, full transcript replay, tool error replay, backend tool ID propagation, interleaved tool tracking, and fail-closed proactive compaction recovery; `go test ./...` passes.
- [x] **Canto dependency refresh foundation (`tk-fblb`)** — Updated Ion to Canto `f47e7de`; migrated request processors from `canto/context` to `canto/prompt` and hooks from `Hook/NewFunc` to `Handler/FromFunc`; `go test ./...` passes.
- [x] **Current Pi core-loop review (`tk-ulfg`)** — Added `ai/research/pi-current-core-loop-review-2026-04.md`; Pi remains the strongest loop reference, but core reliability gates `/tree`, compaction polish, and SOTA routing work.
- [x] **Subagents: runtime semantics and lifecycle (`tk-5vrj`)** — Implemented multiplexed subagent tracking, durable breadcrumbs, and multiplexed event routing in broker.
- [x] **Subagents: inline Plane B presentation (`tk-arhu`)** — Compact worker rows, collapse rules, and parent waiting states implemented in viewport.
- [x] **TUI: boundary-respecting history navigation** — `Up`/`Down`/`Ctrl+P`/`Ctrl+N` now only trigger history navigation at the top/bottom of the multiline composer.
- [x] **Stabilize inline agent loop and TUI (`tk-7kga`)** — Verified streaming, tool lifecycle, approval flow, and error presentation with new tests.

- [x] **Sandbox support (`tk-8s0h`)** — Opt-in bash sandbox planning added with `off`/`auto`/`seatbelt`/`bubblewrap` modes.
- [x] **Retry behavior (`tk-kz3k`)** — Native providers retry transient generation and streaming errors automatically before surfacing a final failure.
- [x] **Canto Context Governor (`tk-4ft8`)** — Runtime now auto-compacts on overflow and proactively compacts before a turn when session usage is near the context limit.
- [x] **Agent Loop: UX Streaming & Reflection Prompts (`tk-hgp4`)** — Background compaction, configurable tool/thinking verbosity, reflexion processor for failed tool calls.
- [x] **Review fixes (`tk-uzoz`, `tk-c0ci`, `tk-l9ag`)** — Registered reflexionProcessor, fixed compaction-failure hang, unified Plane A/B verbosity, added normalizeVerbosity validation.
